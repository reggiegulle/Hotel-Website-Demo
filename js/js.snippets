@Rpiechura - Its markdown, so you can use three ` characters to signal the start and end of a code block.

@GeoJunkie - The cell().data()DT method sounds like what you want. Something like table.cell( this, 0 ).data() will give you the data for the cell in column index 0, for row this.

Got it! The click event needs to point to the row. This code worked:
	
$(function() {
    var opportunityTable = $("#dataTable").DataTable({
        "ajax" : {
            "url": "opportunitiesJson.json?json=1",
            "dataSrc": ""
        },
        "deferRender" : true,
        "columns":[
            { "data":"id" },
            { "data":"sponsor" },
            { "data":"title" },
            { "data":"deadline" }
        ],
        "columnDefs": [
            { "visible" : false, "targets": [0] }
        ],
        "order" : [[ 3, "asc" ]]
    });
     
    $("#dataTable tbody").on('click', 'tr', function () {
        console.log(opportunityTable.cell( this, 0 ).data());
    });
});

Thanks!
